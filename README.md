##_Estimation of Cannon ball trajectry using Kalman Filter in Matlab_

## Introduction
This project performs two main taks:
* Simulation of cannon ball projectile motion (trajectry).
* Implementation of a multi-variable linear Kalman filter which is then used to estimate the trajectory of cannon ball.

## Motivation
This project was created as a university project.

## Usage
To run this project:
* Download all the matlab source files in a working directory.
* Open Matlab and add this directly in your path.
* Run "cannon_ball_kalman.m" file.

## Reference
This project is based on a great tutorial on cannon ball trajectory which can be found here:
"Kalman Filters for Undergrads" http://greg.czerniak.info/node/5.
