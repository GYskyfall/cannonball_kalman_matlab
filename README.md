# cannonball_kalman_matlab
_Estimation of Cannon ball trajectry using Kalman Filter in Matlab

## What the project is?
This project performs two main taks:
* Simulation of cannon ball projectile motion (trajectry).
* Implementation of a multi-variable linear Kalman filter which is then used to estimate the trajectory of cannon ball.

## Motivation
This project was created as a university project.

## Usage
* To run this project, download all the matlab source files in a workable directory
* Open matlab and add this directly in your path.
* Run "cannon_ball_kalman.m" file.

## Reference
This project is based on a great tutorial on cannon ball trajectory which can be found here:
"Kalman Filters for Undergrads" http://greg.czerniak.info/node/5.
